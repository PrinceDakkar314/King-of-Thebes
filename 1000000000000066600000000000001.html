<p>Hello there I am Hermes. How ya doing?</p>
    <p>Well look at you. You look like shit. Yes, you're dead. And I'm here to take care of your shade</p>
    <p> Let check the papers real quick. Oh, you're a scientist. You weren't by any chance killed in the name of Yahweh were ya?</p>
    <p> Nah I am just joking. You know how greedy for money and power the church can be.</p>
    <p> Anyway, I hope you have your obol with ya.. What. You don't. Well shit. I hope you like wandering the coastline for hundred of years. Because you are fucked</p>

    <p> Why, you ask? Well I am not supposed to say this but Hades himself is already waiting for you. The orders come from way above.</p>
    <p>  Somehow your invenction, although it kinda pleased Hephaestus, it really pissed off Terpsichore. And you know how Zeus likes pretty women. Ah! You should've sticked to smelling daisies. You humans really want everything.</p>
